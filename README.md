# JavaScript Proxies Practical Use Cases

This repository contains four practical use cases of JavaScript Proxies, demonstrating their flexibility and usefulness in various scenarios.

## Use Cases

- **CreateReactiveStore** - Data visualization, data binding, and access control use case. This demonstrates how Proxies can be used to create a reactive store for managing application state with data binding and access control features.

- **CreateRPCProxy** - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) with Web Workers use case. This example shows how to use JavaScript Proxies and Web Workers to create an RPC proxy for offloading computationally intensive tasks to a separate thread.

- **MemoizedFetchWeatherData** - Memoization and caching use case. This use case demonstrates how JavaScript Proxies can be utilized for memoization and caching to improve the performance of an application by avoiding repetitive and time-consuming calculations.

- **WorkerPoolWithProxies** - Asynchronous API calls use case. This practical example showcases how RPC with Web Workers can be used in combination with JavaScript Proxies to parallelize network requests and improve the overall performance of a web application.
